/*Happy Numbers: 
*A happy number is defined by the following process.Starting with any positive
*integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process
*until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does 
*not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while 
*those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers. Display an example of your output here.
*Find first 8 happy numbers.
